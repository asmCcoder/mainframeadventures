This are just some examples I'm putting together meanwhile I re-learn COBOL.

I'm by no means an expert on COBOL or mainframes, so use it with caution. My experience with COBOL was more than 20 years ago in OS/390 and AS/400

# COBOL V2 for MVS 3.8

* **TEMPLATE**: Template with (almost) all DIVISION and SECTION.
* **CONDITIO**: Example of use of conditional statements (IF/ELSE, IF NOT, SIGN, CLASS, CONDITION-NAME, AND).
* **ARITHMET**: Example of arithmetic operations (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, COMPUTE).
* **ARRAYS**: Example of arrays (TABLE).
* **READSEQ**: Example of use of READ and DISPLAY with a Sequential file.

# IBM Enterprise COBOL for zOS

* **TEMPLATE**: Template with (almost) all DIVISION and SECTION.
* **CONDITIO**: Example of use of conditional statements (IF/ELSE, IF NOT, SIGN, CLASS, CONDITION-NAME, EVALUATE, AND/OR).
* **ARITHMET**: Example of arithmetic operations (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, COMPUTE).
* **ARRAYS**: Example of arrays (TABLE).
* **STRINGS**: Example of string manipulation.
* **WRITESEQ**: Example of use WRITE to add records to a Sequential file.
* **READSEQ**: Example of use of READ and DISPLAY with a Sequential file.
* **READSEQ2**: Example of use of READ, DISPLAY and STRING with a Sequential file.
* **REWRTSEQ**: Example of use REWRITE to change a record on a Sequential file.
* **CALLSUB1**: Example of calling by REFERENCE a COBOL subroutine.
* **CALLSUB2**: Example of calling by CONTENT a COBOL subroutine.
* **CALLSUB3**: Subroutine to be called (cannot be executed independently).


More to come... *soon*

Many thanks to the folks at https://groups.io/g/H390-MVS that helped me to finish READSEQ for MVS 3.8
